# hello-world
Starting out
Hello, My name is Stefanie. I'm here to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript by auditing a course on coursera. I hope to use this knowledge to help me with my new website and blog, with my work, and because I enjoy learning new things. I am a full time student(Mastering in Psychology/certification in Phlebotomy), mother, and blogger and on my free time I enjoy hiking, playing piano, reading tarot, spending time with my husband, family, and friends, and traveling. If anyone would like to know more about me, contact me.
